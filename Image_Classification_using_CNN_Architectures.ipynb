By visualizing its filters and corresponding feature maps, we can observe how different kernels respond to different regions of an input image.

        "GoogLeNet trained on CIFAR-10 shows strong feature learning capability with reasonable generalization. The training and validation accuracy curves indicate mild overfitting, which can be mitigated using regularization or transfer learning. Inception architecture enables efficient deep learning with fewer parameters compared to traditional CNNs."

        "For a healthcare AI system with limited labeled X-ray data, transfer learning using a ResNet architecture is the most suitable approach. ResNet’s residual connections enable deep feature learning while preventing vanishing gradients, making it highly effective for medical image classification. Fine-tuning pre-trained models reduces computational cost and improves generalization. For deployment, the model should be served via a secure API with explainability tools like Grad-CAM, continuous monitoring, and compliance with healthcare data regulations."
